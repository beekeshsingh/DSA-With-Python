Linked Lists
A linked list consists of nodes with some sort of data, and a pointer, or link, to the next node.

    * A big benefit with using linked lists is that nodes are stored wherever there is free space in memory, the nodes do not have to be stored contiguously right after each other like elements are stored in arrays. Another nice thing with linked lists is that when adding or removing nodes, the rest of the nodes in the list do not have to be shifted.
    * The easiest way to understand linked lists is perhaps by comparing linked lists with arrays.
